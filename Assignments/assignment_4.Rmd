In this assignment, we'll read in a list of fish types. Then we'll run this list through a function that returns the most common and rarest fish, as well as the total number of fish.
```{r}
### read in fish txt file
fish <- read.delim(here('data/fish.txt'))

### read in fish function
source(here('R/fish_function.R'))

### find the answers!
fish_results <- fish_counts(fish)
fish_results
```
